## 🧐 What is Leaphlet?
### Description
Our project, Leaphlet, is a digital brochure app created as an attempt to reduce paper waste at events, exhibitions and symposiums. The exhibitor's version allows exhibitors of an event to upload their company profile and leaflet to the app, and others invited to the event can view and save leaflets from different booths and companies through the visitor version. 
### Our Goals for Solution Challenge
The United Nations’ [Sustainable Development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) we were aiming to solve was #12 Responsible Consumption and Production, #13 Climate Action, and #15 Life on Land. Through our app, we aim to reduce paper waste and prevent deforestation. 
### Main Features
- Visitor:
    - view / star / download pamphlets registered in events
- Exhibitor:
    - upload pamphlets to events
- Organizer: 
    - create events
